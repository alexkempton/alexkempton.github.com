	<b>Hello world!</b>
	<p>What is this? A homepage? A blog? At the moment it's a test site for my new project; to build a databaseless, filebased, javascript-driven html5 blog engine. Read more about it on <a href="">this page</a>.</p>
	<p>IÂ´m sure I'll do some blogging here too, om my favourite tech and programming subjects: java, javascript, c# and sharepoint development. And most importantly: html5, especially the canvas element!</p>
