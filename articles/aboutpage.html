	<b>about this page</b>
	<p>As I have written on the frontpage: the goal of the project behind this page is to build a databaseless, filebased, javascript-driven html5 blog engine. The rationale behind this is to make a template based blog that can be hosted on a web host that just serves static pages, meaning no database or server based scripting. The perfect example is the place I am hosting this page, <a href="http://pages.github.com/">github pages</a>.</p>
	<p>To get an idea of what I am aiming at, here is the workflow to publish this page. I have a html file with the text you are reading here. Then I add a simple entry with the name, linkname and category of the post in a json text file. I publish it by commiting it to git and push it to github. Its faster than wordpress....</p> 
		
	<p>The project has just started, so the code is small end erry, but you can check it out if you like, at my <a href="https://github.com/alexkempton/alexkempton.github.com">github repository</a>
